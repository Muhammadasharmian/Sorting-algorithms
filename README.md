# Sorting-algorithms
This repository contains various sorting algorithms that I have studied throughout my degree.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort
- **Location**: `Bubble-Sort/Bubblesort.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(nÂ²) worst/average case, O(n) best case
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Description**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

### 2. Merge Sort
- **Location**: `Merge-Sort/mergesort.py`
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) all cases
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Description**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run independently:

```bash
# Run Bubble Sort
python3 Bubble-Sort/Bubblesort.py

# Run Merge Sort
python3 Merge-Sort/mergesort.py
```

Both files include example test cases demonstrating the sorting algorithms on various types of input arrays.
